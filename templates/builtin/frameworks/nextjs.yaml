  This is a Next.js project - a React framework with server-side rendering.
  Key conventions:
  - App Router: pages in app/ directory with page.tsx files
  - Pages Router: pages in pages/ directory
  - API routes in app/api/ or pages/api/
  - Server Components by default in App Router
  - Use 'use client' directive for client components
  - Prefer server actions for mutations
