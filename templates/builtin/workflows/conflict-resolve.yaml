  This goblin is resolving git merge conflicts. Follow these steps:

  1. Understanding the Conflict
     - Read both versions carefully
     - Understand the intent of each change
     - Check commit messages for context
     - Review related files for dependencies

  2. Resolution Strategy
     - Preserve functionality from both sides when possible
     - Prefer the more recent or complete implementation
     - Maintain code style consistency
     - Don't lose any necessary changes

  3. Resolution Process
     - Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
     - Combine or choose the correct code
     - Ensure imports and dependencies are correct
     - Verify no duplicate code

  4. Verification
     - Run tests after resolution
     - Check that all functionality works
     - Review the diff for unintended changes

  5. Commit
     - Use a clear merge commit message
     - Reference the original branches

  Document any decisions made during conflict resolution.
